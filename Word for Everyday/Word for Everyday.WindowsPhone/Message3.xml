Most of all, He wants to restore your relationship with Him. God doesn’t want you simply to feel a little better for a few days. No, God is in the long-term restoration business. He doesn’t want you simply to survive that marriage. He wants to turn it around and restore to you a strong, healthy relationship. God doesn’t want your business to merely make it through the murky economic waters. He wants your business to excel! Start expecting things to change in your favour. It’s your faith that activates the power of God. Remember, if you obey God and are willing to trust Him, you will have the best this life has to offer — and more.

Change needs to be conceived on the inside before you perceive it on the outside. You have to work with God. It all starts with the decision to change. In the Old Testament, there was a widow who faced a severe financial situation. She was in such financial need that the creditors were after her and wanted to take her son as a slave. The prophet Elisha showed up at her house with instructions from God for her situation and it had to do with the little of her resources that she had. All she had was one jar of oil. With one jar, and obediently gathering jars from her neighbors at the request of Elisha, she backed up her faith with actions and obedience. She followed a plan. When her miracle occurred, she not only had enough oil to fill each jar and pay off her debts, but she was well about to sell the oil and live off the rest.(Bible Verse-1 Kings 17:7-16)."

Worship is not something we do once or twice a week when we happen to be sitting in a pew somewhere; it’s a lifestyle, a habit, an attitude of our heart.

It’s always there because we are made by God and for God, and because of sin we are separated from Him. We know we need Him, and we long to be made right with Him; we just don’t know how.

God is not waiting for you to become a better person before He forgives you. Jesus paid the price on the cross for all our sins — “while we were yet sinners Christ died for us,” the Bible says in Romans 5:8. He did it simply because He loves you and wants to have a relationship with you. And the result of this astounding, unconditional love and total forgiveness is that we no longer have to live under the condemnation and guilt of sin.

When you give in to those thoughts, you stop the transformation process. When you are filled with doubt and unbelief, God’s miracle for you is put on hold.

Not next week when we feel like it, or next month when our circumstances are better. No, we need to do it immediately. Procrastination — putting off till later what we ought to do now — is so easy to justify. We think, One day I’m going to do that, so I’m not really being disobedient. We say, “Someday, I’m going to get serious about my relationship with God, but not right now.” Or, “One day, I’m going to get back in shape.” “One day I’m going to get my finances in order.” Or, “Sometime soon, I’m going to forgive that person that hurt me.” Unfortunately, for many people, one day never comes. Rather than being a procrastinator, be a “now” person. Start doing what God has put in your heart right now. Don’t merely intend to be obedient, promptly obey.(Bible Verse-Proverbs 20:4, Proverbs 27:1)."

This is something that is summed up in the words of the Lord’s Prayer: 'Your Kingdom Come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' Prayer is one of the ways that God invites us into a creative partnership that includes us in the process of exploring the margins of the future. God may know the future but we do not.

One day, a friend who was not a Christian stopped at the blacksmith's shop to talk to him. Sympathizing with him in some of his trials, the friend said. 'It seems strange to me that so much affliction should come to you just at the time when you have become an earnest Christian. Of course, I don't want to weaken your faith in God or anything like that. But here you are, with God's help and guidance, and yet things seem to be getting steadily worse.

I take a piece and heat it in the fire until it is red, almost white with the heat. Then I hammer it unmercifully, to shape it as I know it should be shaped. Then I plunge it into a pail of cold water to temper it. Then I heat it again and hammer it some more. And this I do until it is finished.' 'But sometimes I find a piece of iron that won't stand up under this treatment. The heat and the hammering and the cold water are too much for it. I don't know why it fails in the process, but I know it will never make a good horse's shoe.' He pointed to a heap of scrap iron that was near the door of his shop. 'When I get a piece that cannot take the shape and temper, I throw it out on the scrap heap. It will never be good for anything.' He went on, 'I know that God has been holding me in the fires of affliction and I have felt His hammer upon me. But I don't mind, if only He can bring me to what I should be. And so, in all these hard things my prayer is simply this: Try me in any way you wish, Lord, only don't throw me on the scrap heap.'

The most powerful resource we have as God’s people is in looking to God in prayer, believing Him to move the mountains that threaten to destroy this us.(Bible Verse-Matthew 17:14-21)."

He says, 'If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth'(Mark 9:23). He says, 'Call unto Me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not' (Jeremiah. 33:3). He says, 'This is the confidence that we have in Him, if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us and if we know that He hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desire of Him' (1 John 5:14-15). Hebrews 11:6 says, 'Those who come to God must believe that God is.' God is what? God is able to do anything and everything! God is willing to release His supernatural divine power in human circumstances if He can find somebody who is willing to believe Him and expect Him to do it. Do you believe that God will move the mountains that keep us from being the people God wants us to be, or from being the nation God wants us to be?"

One of the most beautiful examples of the right kind of praying is in 2 Chronicles 20 when Jehoshaphat heard that his enemy was approaching. What did he do? He didn’t call a committee! The Scriptures say he fell on his face before the Lord and cried to Him for rescue and protection. He didn’t begin by saying, 'O God, look at our enemy; look how strong they are; look how powerful they are!' No! He began by saying, 'O God, Thou art the Creator. You are the one who brought us out of Egypt.' He began to pray a prayer that focused completely on God. And the next day the Scripture says, he went out to meet the enemy. Do you know how he went out? He went out with his choir out in front of his army singing their way to victory. Why was he able to do this? Because Jehoshaphat knew that the secret to mountain moving is to focus upon the God who moves the mountains and not on the mountains themselves.(Bible Verse-2 Chronicles 20)."

It means to 'lose heart, to give up' because the answer doesn’t come immediately. How many of us are willing to pray with the same tenacity that Jacob had when he wrestled the angel? He said,' I’ll not let you go until you do what I want done.' prayer that comes to God expecting Him to do something…I believe God is looking for people who are willing to hold on to Him, to bombard heaven, to keep on asking until the asking becomes praising and thanksgiving. The kind of prayer that moves mountains may start off in weakness, but it ends up in strength. It may begin with asking, but it ends up in thanking.

When you begin to feel what God feels, something will absolutely transform your prayer life.

It declares that your devotion to Him is more important than eating, more important than sleeping, more important than fellowship. It means you are willing to bear the burden of God, willing to become what God wants you to be in order for God to use you the way He wants to.

   InspMessage="The scripture in James 5:16 itself provides a key to effective prayer when it uses the word 'fervent.' 'The effective, FERVENT prayer of a righteous man avails much.' A prayer quote that I like very much says; 'Our prayers must mean something to us if they are to mean anything to God.' Think of Hannah in the Old Testament.(See 1 Samuel 1:8-20) Hannah was barren and she was desperate to have a child. The scripture describes her as having bitterness of soul and of weeping in anguish. Her situation had been going on for years until she was so serious about her request that she made a very difficult vow to the Lord. She vowed that if God would give her a male child she would give him back to the Lord. The child would be put in God's service for full time ministry for his entire life. The answer to Hannah's prayer ended up being Samuel, one of the greatest prophetic voices in the Old Testament and the man who anointed Israel's first kings. The scripture is full of other examples of such desperate prayers. It is in desperation that God sees how serious we are about what we are asking. We find that out too. You can't usually conjure up desperation. Some prayers grow more desperate over time and these are usually the ones that meet with the success that Hannah had. The desperate prayer pays a great price but produces a great pay off."

One of the most difficult things I have personally had to come to terms with as a Christian is that God's timeframe is so different from mine. The bulldog spirit is helpful at such times; you just continue to go after it until you get it. Jesus told a parable specifically designed to encourage people to keep on asking until the results come in. It's called 'The Parable of the Persistent Widow' in Luke 18:1-8. In it he acknowledges that some things are going to take time but that God expects and encourages us to continue and that we will see results AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Sometimes God has a whole lot of background stuff to do in order to get the answer ready to come to fruition.

For others, Christ's return isn't on the radar of their brain at all and so they go on living like there is no tomorrow. That mentality says; 'eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.' Both groups will eventually face a day when Jesus actually does return again because what God promises will come to pass. How do we really stay alert? It isn't a matter of stopping life and staring up into the sky. That's what the disciples did when Jesus ascended into heaven but the angels told them: 'Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched Him go into heaven.' (Acts 1:11) Being alert as we wait means being about God's kingdom business. It means fulfilling the commands he left us with, particularly to make disciples of all nations and to bring in the harvest of souls waiting to hear the good news. We can spend a day, a week or a month and not give one thought to the actual second return of Christ and still be 'on the alert.'

Sometimes God presents opportunities that look insignificant, or rather ordinary. Perhaps you don’t see how they fit into the big picture for your life. But if God is asking you to do something, He has a purpose for it. You just need to be faithful, and when you’re diligent in handling the little things, God can increase and promote you to larger responsibilities. (Bible Verse-Ephesians 3:20)."

     InspMessage="Friend, How do you show God you’re willing and able to handle more? By being faithful with what you’ve been given. You may think you’re working at some meaningless job, or you’re just raising your kids, or you’re doing something that seems ordinary, it’s not exciting; you can’t see where it’s leading you. Let me encourage you to be faithful. Stick with it. Give it your all. Keep a good attitude, and God will increase you. If you will be the best that you can be right where you are, God will promote you and give you more. (Bible Verse-Luke 16:10)."

     InspMessage="Understand that those silent times — those times when God is doing something in your life that doesn’t seem to make sense — those are times of growth. God is working on your character. That’s when God is preparing you, and if you’ll be faithful and pass the test, you’ll be ready for promotion. Many people are not willing to go through the tough times. They’re not willing to stick it out. They’re not willing to use their talents for God when their efforts go unnoticed. Some people don’t use their gifts and talents because they’re in a negative circumstance. Maybe they don’t like the job they’re in. Or they’re constantly around people that they dislike. So they’re sitting back waiting for God to move them and give them another opportunity, to put them where they can more easily use their gifts and talents. Then they’ll have a good attitude and do what God has told them to do. But the Bible teaches us to make the most of every opportunity, not just when the circumstances are fun and exciting. No, we have to use our gifts and talents no matter what situation we’re in.(Bible Verse-Daniel 1)."

     InspMessage="Friend, I think about Joseph. He was sold into slavery. If anybody had a right to have a bad attitude and feel sorry for himself, Joseph did. But Joseph realized that God had placed leadership qualities and administrative skills in him, so he continued to develop his potential in spite of his negative circumstances. He was falsely accused and thrown into prison, but he kept using the gifts God had given him, even there. Joseph did the right things although wrong things were happening to him. Before long, Joseph was promoted to be in charge of the entire prison, and because of his persistence and his discipline, he continued to rise to the top, eventually becoming the second highest official in the country of Egypt.

     InspMessage="The Bible says that your gifts and talents will make room for you. That means if you’ll stick with it, be persistent, and continue to use what God has given you, those gifts will cause you to move forward and help you to make progress in your life. You will rise to the top. You have a deep well of talent on the inside of you, but the only way to get that talent up and out of you is through persistence. You must be determined. You’ve got to learn not to embrace the obstacles but embrace the opportunities. When we stay with it and do our best, listening to God and learning the lessons that He wants us to know, He’ll draw those deep talents out of us. God wants to do something similar for every one of us. He wants to bring out the talents we don’t even know we have, and He wants to give us a greater opportunity to be of service. But our untapped talent and potential will lie dormant for a lifetime unless we’re willing to get busy where we are right now, doing what God is showing us to do. We can’t just sit around waiting for the big opportunity, dreaming about all the wonderful things that God wants to do in our lives. No, we need to invest our talents wisely right now.(Bible Verse-Matthew 25:14-30)."

What would our offices be like? What would our schools be like if we made it a priority to brighten somebody else’s day? Scripture teaches “Every opportunity we have we should do good to people” (see Galatians 6:10). That means we need to be on the lookout. We need to be proactive. We need to have the mindset of, “Who can I bless today?” “For whom can I do a favor?” You can’t just sit back and wait for the need to come to you. You have to go after it.

     InspMessage="Friends, all around us are hurting people who need our love and encouragement. Don’t miss the miracle of the moment. Don’t be too busy, or insensitive to the needs of those around you. Be willing to be inconvenienced. Be sensitive and pay attention to those around you, your friends, your coworkers and your relatives. Listen to what they’re saying. We shouldn’t miss opportunities to do good whenever situations come across our paths to bless people.  Proverbs 19:17 says, “He who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his good deed.” When you give to those in need, you are lending to God. And God knows how to pay you back — with interest! You may not be able to give money, but you can baby sit that single mom’s children. Why don’t you give her a break one night? Tell her, “You go do something special for yourself. Here’s a gift certificate. You go up to the mall. You go get your nails done. Our family is going to keep your children tonight.” (Bible Verse- Proverbs 19:17)."

Why don’t you take a single parent family along with you? Or better yet, be a mentor to one of those young children. That doesn’t take a lot of money. It just takes time and love. That just takes somebody that cares, somebody that’s willing to make a difference. Love is seen in our actions. This world does not need to hear another sermon nearly as much as it needs to see us being good to people. (Bible Verse-Matthew 25:40)."

When you let somebody in traffic in front of you, you may never see that person again. When you give somebody twenty dollars because you had compassion in your heart, you may never hear back from them, but let me assure you, God is keeping the records. He’s seen every time you’ve been good to somebody. He’s heard every encouraging word you’ve spoken. God has seen all the times you went out of your way to help somebody but they never even said thank you. The Scripture says when you do things in secret, when you do things without getting any credit, when nobody thanks you, God sees it, and you will even receive a greater reward.

People are watching us, and one of the best witnesses we could have is simply by being good to people. If you’ll get up every day and focus on how you can be a blessing and not just on how you can get blessed, God will meet your own needs as you meet others’ needs. God will meet all your needs in abundance! The Scripture says people will know true Christians by their fruit (see Matthew 7:15–23). They’re not going to know us by how many scriptures we quote. They’re not going to know us by how many Christian bumper stickers we have on our car. People are going to really know that we’re believers when we’re helping other people, meeting needs, doing good works, when we are blessing people with our words and our actions.

You can either develop an eye for the good, or you can develop a critical eye and always see the bad. This is why marriages are in so much trouble today. A spouse or both spouses have developed a habit of being negative and only seeing the negative. They’ve become too critical and view everything through their critical eye. You see, you can train yourself to see your spouse’s strengths, or you can train yourself to see their weaknesses. You can focus on what you like about your spouse and magnify their good qualities, or you can focus on what you don’t like and magnify the things that annoy you. f you’re negative toward your spouse and you operate out of a critical spirit, it’s going to poison your whole outlook. You won’t communicate properly. You won’t want to do things together, and it will affect you in every area. So, watch out. (Bible Verse-Titus 2:1-15; Proverbs 31:10-12; Ephesians 5:25)."

Every day go over it. Start focusing on their good qualities. You have to make a switch. Decide today to start appreciating your spouse’s strengths and learn to downplay their weaknesses.

You can have everything, but if you lack good relationships, you are unfulfilled and empty. On the other hand, you can have very little, but if you have friends and fulfilling relationships, you are rich! It’s sad to say, but many people only know what it’s like to have dysfunctional relationships. There are so many homes that are full of strife and marriages not at peace. That is not God’s best for your marriage. God wants you to enjoy your spouse. I believe with all my heart, that God divinely connected you with your mate. He wants you to enjoy your spouse and not be at odds with him or her. (Bible Verse-1 Peter 3:1-6; Colossians 3:14)."

Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. All great marriages take work. Make it your goal to daily remember these biblical points. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you and to bring to your attention whenever you’re tempted to act out of love. And remember, where there is peace, God commands a blessing!"
